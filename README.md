  ## About
In the real world, people's achievements are endorsed by the state and institutions that issue certificates, such as university diplomas in China, which are verified by universities and the Ministry of Education and have official websites that provide verification services.

<br>In the web 3 world made up of the entire Ethereum ecosystem and other public chains, we combine some cool innovations and let them react with each other, generating self-certifying NFTs as a decentralized visual credential with the entire process and NFT metadata all on the chain as much as possible.

<br>For a more decentralized on-chain storage of NFT's metadata, we chose Ethereum’s Layer 2. Currently, we support Polygon. In the future, we will support other Layer2 scaling solutions including Optimistic, Arbitrum, etc.

  ## Why Layer 2
  
  ## EXAMPLE 1: The Graph Curator Metafication
 
Metaficate was built for the [Layer2 Hackathon](http://hackathon.iosg.vc/?ref=metaficate) launched by [IOSG VENTURES](https://iosg.vc/?ref=metaficate) and [CHAINLINK](https://chain.link/?ref=metaficate). This is an attempt to start from scratch, the product still needs to be perfected.

<br>The Graph Curator Metaficate is a sufficiently complex Metaficate use case. 
	
<br>Curators use their knowledge of the web3 ecosystem to assess and signal on the subgraphs that should be indexed by The Graph Network. If an address has had at least one relevant onchain interaction before the snapshot time, then its owner can click the claim button on the demo page to get a metaficate NFT.

<br>Recently, the POAP badge NFTs, distributed by The Graph, has been subjected to a number of malicious attacks that hit random numbers in the claim links. This resulted in some eligible developers not receiving their POAPs, and both the NFT and the corresponding GRT rewards were stolen by the attackers.

<br>Unlike NFTs such as POAP and Galaxy.eco, Metaficate NFTs are created, generated and claimmed on the blockchain. This decentralized native NFT prevents NFTs belonging to a particular address from becoming fraudulent and ensures ensuring that its data can almost never be lost or tampered with.
	 that it is virtually impossible for their data to be lost or tampered with.

Metaficate是为 [IOSG VENTURES](https://iosg.vc/?ref=metaficate) 和 [CHAINLINK](https://chain.link/?ref=metaficate) 发起的 [Layer2 Hackathon](http://hackathon.iosg.vc/?ref=metaficate) 而建立的。这是一次从零开始的尝试，产品仍然需要完善。

<br>Graph Curator Metaficate 是一个足够复杂的 Metaficate 用例。

<br>策展人利用他们对 web3 生态系统的了解，对应该被图谱网络索引的子图进行评估并发出信号。如果一个地址在快照时间之前至少有一次相关的链上互动，那么它的所有者可以点击演示页面上的声称按钮来获得metaficate NFT。

<br>最近，由 The Graph 分发的 POAP 徽章 NFT 受到了一些撞认领链接中随机数的恶意的攻击。这导致一些符合条件的开发者没有收到他们的 POAP，NFT 和相应的 GRT 奖励都被攻击者窃取了。

<br>不同于 POAP 和 Galaxy.eco 等NFT，Metaficate NFT 是在区块链上创建、生成和认领的。这种去中心化的原生 NFT 既避免了属于某个地址的 NFT 被人冒领，又确保其数据几乎不可能丢失或被篡改。


## More use cases
On-chain certifacate without centralized endorsement: Metaficate's whitelist data sources, generation codes and NFT card information are all stored on the chain, which will strengthen the security of the contract in the future and establish a common standard to serve more web3 users.

<br>More efficient community management: Community managers can use some existing tools, for example, the collab.land robot that already supports Polygon NFT, to establish accurate user classification for community discord and telegram groups and improve the efficiency of community management.

<br>DAO governance: Metaficate will add whitelist extraction for DAO contracts, allowing DAO members to claim membership card-style Metaficate NFTs that will be able to be used directly in the web3 governance platform being developed by RhizomeDAO and our partners.

<br>Visual records in the metaverse: in the metaverse you will be able to show your past on the chain like an artwork, i.e. a Metaficate NFT storing different on-chain actions. in the future, as some generative artists join the Metaficate ecosystem as curators, users will be able to get Metaficate NFTs with a higher artistic quality.

<br>无需中心化背书的链上凭证：Metaficate 的白名单数据来源、生成代码和 NFT 卡片信息全部存于链上，未来将加强合约的安全性，建立通用标准，服务更多web3用户；

<br>更加高效的社区管理：社区管理者可以借助现有的一些工具，比如已支持 Polygon NFT的 collab.land 机器人，为社区的 discord 和 telegram 群组建立精准的用户分类，提高社区管理效率；

<br>DAO 治理：Metaficate 将增加 DAO 合约的白名单提取功能，让 DAO 成员能够铸造会员卡式的 Metaficate NFT；RhizomeDAO 和我们的合作伙伴开发的 web3 治理平台中，这些 NFT 将能直接使用； 

<br>元宇宙中的可视化记录：在元宇宙中，您将可以像展示艺术品一样展示您在链上的过去，即存储不同的链上行为的 Metaficate NFT。未来，随着一些生成艺术家作为策展人加入  Metaficate 生态，用户将能够获得艺术性更高的 Metaficate NFT。
