  ## About
In the real world, people's achievements are endorsed by the state and institutions that issue certificates, such as university diplomas in China, which are verified by universities and the Ministry of Education and have official websites that provide verification services.

<br>In the web 3 world made up of the entire Ethereum ecosystem and other public chains, we combine some cool innovations and let them react with each other, generating self-certifying NFTs as a decentralized visual credential with the entire process and NFT metadata all on the chain as much as possible.

<br>For a more decentralized on-chain storage of NFT's metadata, we chose Ethereumâ€™s Layer 2. Currently, we support Polygon. In the future, we will support other Layer2 scaling solutions including Optimistic, Arbitrum, etc.

  ## Why Layer 2
  
  ## EXAMPLE 1: The Graph Curator Metafication

## More use cases
On-chain certifacate without centralized endorsement: Metaficate's whitelist data sources, generation codes and NFT card information are all stored on the chain, which will strengthen the security of the contract in the future and establish a common standard to serve more web3 users.

More efficient community management: Community managers can use some existing tools, such as the collab.land robot that already supports Polygon NFT, to establish accurate user classification for community discord and telegram groups and improve the efficiency of community management.

DAO governance: Metaficate will add whitelist extraction for DAO contracts, allowing DAO members to cast membership card-style Metaficate NFTs that will be able to be used directly in the web3 governance platform being developed by RhizomeDAO.

Visual records in the metaverse: in the metaverse you will be able to show your past on the chain like an artwork, i.e. a Metaficate NFT storing different on-chain actions. in the future, as some generative artists join the Metaficate ecosystem as curators, users will be able to access Metaficate NFTs with a higher artistic quality.
